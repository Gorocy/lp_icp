    <h2>About Liquidity Pool Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      This liquidity pool implementation is written in Rust and includes key components and methods 
      that simulate the behavior of a liquidity pool in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Initialization</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>LpPool::init</code> function initializes the liquidity pool with the given parameters:
      <code>price</code>, <code>min_fee</code>, <code>max_fee</code>, and <code>liquidity_target</code>. 
      These parameters are validated to ensure that:
      <ul>
        <li><code>min_fee</code> is less than <code>max_fee</code>.</li>
        <li><code>price</code> is greater than 0.</li>
        <li><code>liquidity_target</code> is greater than 0.</li>
      </ul>
    <!-- </p may be> -->
        
    <h3>Adding Liquidity</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>add_liquidity</code> function allows users to deposit tokens into the pool. The function 
      calculates the amount of liquidity provider (LP) tokens to mint based on the current value of the pool's 
      assets. This calculation considers the proportion of the pool before and after the deposit.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Removing Liquidity</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>remove_liquidity</code> function enables users to withdraw their share of the pool. It calculates 
      the amount of tokens and staked tokens to return based on the proportion of LP tokens being redeemed. 
      The function ensures that the requested amount is valid and that the pool's reserves are updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is a simulation, each user has an unlimited supply of tokens. If you want to restart the simulation 
      or reset the pool's state, simply use the <code>remove_liquidity</code> function to withdraw all assets.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Swapping Tokens</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>swap</code> function allows users to exchange staked tokens for regular tokens. The function applies 
      a dynamic fee, calculated using the formula:
      <code>unstake_fee = max_fee - (max_fee - min_fee) * amount_after / target</code>. 
      This formula adjusts the fee based on the pool's remaining reserves relative to the target liquidity.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The formula ensures that the fee decreases as the pool approaches its liquidity target, thus encouraging 
      swaps that maintain the pool's balance.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      The code includes various checks and balances to ensure that operations such as adding liquidity, 
      removing liquidity, and swapping tokens are performed safely and within the constraints of the pool's parameters. 
      This implementation could be extended or modified to support additional features or specific DeFi use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this is a simulated environment, and real-world conditions may vary. 
      The unlimited token supply for users is specific to this test scenario.
    </p>
